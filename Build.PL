#
# This file contains information distilled from lib/Net/Wire10.pm into
# a much more concise form by an automated tool.  From here, you can
# use Module::Build to create additional files containing secondary,
# tertiary and quaternary versions of the exact same information.
#
# First, create the Build script and _build cache:
#
# $ perl Build.PL
#
# Then choose an action from this list:
#
# $ perl Build help
#
# Common actions are "help", "test" and "install".
#
# Notice that the install action does not take care of dependencies.
# Use the CPAN module installer for that.
#
# Other common actions are "manifest" for creating a dumb list of files
# and "distmeta" for duplicating the contents of the build cache into
# yet another mimeographic labor-phlebotomiser of a file format :-).
