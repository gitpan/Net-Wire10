CHANGELOG

A hand-written version history for Net-Wire10 is currently not available.

If more contributors join the project, the code will go in source control.
From there a changelog can be distilled with relative ease.

Until then, a good overview of changes can be obtained by diffing current
modules against the POD documentation for earlier releases, available at
http://backpan.perl.org/.
